            <h2 id="blackhole_title" style="color:black; width:50%;">Outer-Event Horizon - Black</h2>
            <h3 id="text" style="color:black; width:80%">The Outer-Event Horizon is also known as the Point of No Return. This is because, if you enter the event horizon, you can't go back outside it. The reason for this is the ridiculously strong gravity.<br>This gravity is so strong, that not even light can escape it! The black part of the black hole that we see is the Outer-Event Horizon.</h3>

            <h2 id="blackhole_title" style="color:grey; width:50%;">Inner-Event Horizon - Grey</h2>
            <h3 id="text" style="color:grey; width:80%">The Inner-Event Horizon is underneath the Outer-Event Horizon. This part has even stronger gravity, so you could just forget about escaping.<br>This is where you get painfully stretched.<br>The gravity is so strong that it starts to stretch anything inside the Inner-Event Horizon for example: a star, a planet, or even a person! The object is stretched so much, it becomes a hot stream of plasma, one atom wide.</h3>
            
            <h2 id="blackhole_title" style="color:red; width:50%;">Singularity - White</h2>
            <h3 id="text" style="color:red; width:80%">The Singularity is dense. It is where all the objects that enter the black hole go to.<br>Since all the things the black hole devours go to the singularity, it is the densest place in the universe! Even though literally everything the black hole devours goes to an infinately small point!</h3>

            <h3 id="text" style="color:orange; width:80%">The fiery disk around the black hole is the ACCRETION DISK. Not all black holes have this. It forms and grows when matter that is pulled in by the black hole orbits it.<br>The tiny bits of matter bump into each other while almost travelling at the speed of light around the black hole, and generate heat.<br>This makes the accretion disk hotter than our sun!</h3>
